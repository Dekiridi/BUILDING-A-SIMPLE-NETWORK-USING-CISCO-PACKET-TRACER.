# Simple Network Building with Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the design, configuration, and security testing of a basic network topology using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, as part of my cybersecurity learning experience with **10Alytics**.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (for network simulation and device configuration)

## 📚 Project Overview
- Built a simple network topology with a server, switch, and three PCs.
- Assigned unique IP addresses within the `192.168.0.x/24` subnet.
- Verified network connectivity using `ping` and real-time messaging.
- Configured a firewall on the server to block ICMP (ping) traffic.
- Tested and confirmed that ICMP traffic was successfully blocked post-configuration.

## 🖥️ Devices and IP Assignments
| Device      | IP Address    | Subnet Mask     |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| DAVIDSERVER0| 192.168.0.1    | 255.255.255.0   |
| DAVIDPC0    | 192.168.0.2    | 255.255.255.0   |
| DAVIDPC1    | 192.168.0.3    | 255.255.255.0   |
| DAVIDPC3    | 192.168.0.4    | 255.255.255.0   |

## 🔒 Key Security Configuration
- Implemented a firewall rule to block ICMP traffic to protect against reconnaissance attacks.
- Verified firewall effectiveness by conducting post-configuration ping tests.

## 📈 Key Takeaways
- Gained hands-on experience with IP addressing, subnetting, and device configuration.
- Understood how basic firewall rules enhance network security.
- Learned how to troubleshoot connectivity issues through practical testing.

## 🧩 Challenges Faced
- Encountered an issue where the server webpage was inaccessible post-firewall configuration — identified firewall rule impacts and planned for further research and improvement.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Explore more granular firewall configurations to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic while restricting undesired protocols.
- Implement VLANs and additional layers of security.
